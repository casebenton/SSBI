									<h3>Michael Chen ('18)</h3>
									<h4>President</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Michael is an undergraduate at Stanford who loves working at
									the intersection of neuroscience, medicine, and public
									service. Having suffered a minor brain injury himself as a
									child, Michael became interested in supporting individuals
									with brain injury and raising public awareness about brain
									injury after arriving at Stanford. Michael worked with medical
									students Alissa Totman and Jackie Konopka to establish
									Stanford Synapse as an official student organization at
									Stanford. Since then, he has had the privilege of leading a
									team of passionate Stanford students to expand the group’s
									reach and impact on the brain injury community. After
									witnessing firsthand the importance of social support in the
									recovery process, Michael has organized initiatives and
									events to bring individuals with brain injury and Stanford
									students together in a safe and supportive environment. More
									recently, Michael has been involved in the founding of
									<a href="//synapsenational.org">Synapse National</a>,
									which is extending the model of the
									student-run support group to create a network of brain injury
									support groups at colleges across the country. After
									graduation, Michael plans to research and treat disorders of
									the brain as a physician scientist.

									Sophie studies Biology, with a concentration in Neurobiology,
									and Art Practice at Stanford. In her second year, Sophie
									assisted with the launch and development of Stanford Synapse
									as a new organization at Stanford. Sophie’s current role in
									Synapse involves organizing gatherings to help bring
									individuals with brain injury together for both social events
									and guest speakers that can be enjoyed with families and
									student buddies. In addition to her interests in neuroscience,
									Sophie is involved in research at the Stanford Cardiovascular
									Institute and plans to pursue an MD/PhD after graduation.

								</header>
								<p>
									Divya is a third-year undergraduate studying Human Biology
									with a focus on Pediatric Public Health. Within Synapse, she
									works to reach more individuals with brain injury throughout

									<h3>Claire Woodrow ('18)</h3>
									<h4>Vice President of Buddy Program</h4>
								</header>
								<p>
									Claire Woodrow is a junior undergraduate student pursuing a
									degree in Human Biology with a concentration in Neuroscience.
									After being introduced to patients suffering from brain
									trauma during high school, her desire for continued
									involvement with the brain injury community led her to
									join Stanford Synapse in its early stages during her
									freshman year. As initiator and organizer of the Buddy
									Program, Claire is inspired by the meaningful friendships
									Synapse helps to facilitate between individuals with brain
									injury and undergraduate students. Her personal experiences
									with her brain injury buddy constantly show her what a great
									impact Synapse has on those it serves. Claire is also a
									founding member of
									<a href="//synapsenational.org">Synapse National</a>,
									an organization which seeks to expand student support for
									the brain injury community to other universities across the
									country. In the future, Claire plans to continue studying the
									brain and hopefully become a physician.

								<p>
									Alissa Totman is an MD/MPH candidate at the Stanford School of
									Medicine and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. As
									an undergraduate she helped lead a student group called the

									with brain injury. In fall of 2014 she joined forces with
									Jaclyn Konopka, fellow BrainTrust alumna and Stanford medical
									student, to start Stanford Synapse. Then in 2016, she created
									Synapse National, which provide undergraduates at universities
									across the US with leadership opportunities expanding social
									support for individuals with brain injury. After completing
									her MD/MPH she plans to pursue residency training in Physical
									Medicine and Rehabilitation and to further specialize in
									Traumatic Brain Injury.
