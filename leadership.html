									<h3>Sani Eskinazi ('20)</h3>
									<h4>President</h4>
									<p>
										Sani is a junior at Stanford majoring in Molecular,
										Cellular, and Developmental Biology with a minor in Economics.
										He enjoys working at the intersection of patient care,
										neuroscience research, and public service. After joining
										the club as a freshman and serving in outreach for a year,
										Sani currently leads the club with Michael’s mentorship.
										His experiences interacting with post brain injury
										individuals via his role in outreach allowed him to assume
										this executive position, and gave him the privilege of
										leading a team of passionate Stanford students. Having
										had a brain injury as a teenager, Sani sees Synapse as
										the optimal platform to learn more about the consequences
										of traumatic brain injury while giving back to society.
										Synapse has allowed Sani to further appreciate medicine’s
										unique role in combining the seemingly distinct fields of
										research and human interaction. After graduation, Sani
										plans on becoming a physician and taking care of patients
										on a daily basis, while also contributing to the management
										side of healthcare.

									<h3>Baylee Bakkila ('20)</h3>
									<h4>VP of Quality Improvement </h4>
									<p>
										Baylee is a junior studying political science and biology.
										She is fascinated by the elusiveness of the brain and its
										functioning - and hopes to be involved in unraveling some of
										the mystery. After experiencing the impact of traumatic
										brain injury and neuronal dysfunction in her own family,
										she decided to join Synapse to help support patients and
										their families when they need it most. She is excited to
										improve the Synapse experience for both core members and
										support group attendees in her role as Vice President of
										Quality Improvement. After graduation, she hopes to attend
										medical school and study public health.

									<p>
										Saket Myneni is a member of Stanford's Class of 2021,
										majoring in Biology. He joined Stanford Synapse as a
										freshman in order to support the brain injury community on
										and around campus. This year, as a sophomore, he is in
										charge of planning and running the annual winter conference
										for people in the community and those wishing to support the
										community. In the future, Saket hopes to attend medical
										school and pursue a career that will allow him to continue
										helping this community. In his free time, Saket enjoys
										playing basketball, reading, and playing the violin.

									<h3>Andrew Bueno ('19)</h3>
									<h4>VP of Buddy Program</h4>
									<p>
										Andrew is a senior majoring in Human Biology with a
										concentration in Neuroscience. Ever since middle school,
										he has been interested in the brain, especially the
										plasticity that is demonstrated after injuries. He is
										interested especially in the connection between	the mind and
										body, a powerful intersection that allows a positive mindset
										and healthy social environment to have dramatic impact on health outcomes
										even at the physiological level. He is excited to help lead the buddy program
										and hopes to expand it this year to maximize the positive
										impact that it can have on the community of individuals with brain injury.

										in chemistry. She joined Stanford Synapse during freshman
										year as a way of supporting the local brain injury community
										and promoting awareness for brain injury. Rena is currently
										the Financial Officer of Stanford Synapse, but she also
										works with Sophia as part of the Events Committee as well.
										In the future, she hopes to go to medical school and pursue

									<h3>Alessandra Marcone ('20)</h3>
									<h4>VP of Outreach</h4>
									<p>
										Alessandra is a junior majoring in Human Biology with a
										minor in Spanish. Her junior year of high school Alessandra
										suffered from two concussions that forced her to quit soccer
										and sent her into a brief period of depression. Upon
										arriving on Stanford Campus, Alessandra joined Stanford
										Synapse as a freshman originally as a member of the core
										Outreach team. She is excited to continue to spread word
										about Stanford Synapse so more individuals with brain
										injuries can know about our peer support group -- a resource
										she believes would have been beneficial to her mental
										health during her own recovery from a concussion. In her
										free time Alessandra loves to dance, sing, and ski on the
										mountains of Alpine Meadows in Tahoe.

									<h3>Tami Alade ('19)</h3>
									<h4>Historian</h4>
									<p>
										Tami is a senior majoring in Human Biology with a focus in
										child health and development. As a member of the varsity
										volleyball team at Stanford, she has been made witness to
										the devastating effect that head trauma can have both on
										the mental and physical health of the athletes around her.
										Tami is inspired by the power of support groups to create
										safe communities that allow for the growth and healing of
										the individuals who participate. In her year with Synapse,
										Tami has worked to document and share the photos and
										memories from the events that took place, and create a
										medium through which memories can be curated forever.
										After college, she hopes to pursue another degree in
										public health, and hopefully attend medical school.

									<h3>Kevin Supakkul ('20)</h3>
									<h4>VP of Peer Support</h4>
									<p>
										I am passionate about Synapse and the Peer Support Group
										because I believe that those with brain injury truly
										benefit from empathy and communal support.  I have
										experienced first hand the difficulties of brain injury,
										having once taken a medical leave of absence from school
										to recover after a concussion.  I saw that brain injury
										can be very isolating and emotionally painful, so I hope to
										help alleviate such hardships for others.  There aren't
										many support resources for those with brain injury, so I
										hope to keep Synapse a beneficial and supportive community
										for this population.

										Alexis Ball is an MD/MPP candidate at the Harvard Medical
										School and Harvard John F Kennedy School of Government. She
										joined the leadership of Synapse in 2016. She has experience
										with the brain injury community both through her work
										advocating for concussion awareness but also personally
										due to a father with a traumatic brain injury. Alexis plans
										on pursuing a career in pediatrics and looks to incorporate
										brain injury advocacy throughout her career.
