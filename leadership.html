									<h3>Michael Zhu Chen ('18)</h3>
									<h4>Co-president</h4>
									<p>
										Michael is an undergraduate at Stanford who loves working at
										the intersection of neuroscience, medicine, and public service.
										Having suffered a minor brain injury himself as a child,
										Michael became interested in supporting individuals with
										brain injury and raising public awareness about brain injury
										after arriving at Stanford. Michael worked with medical
										students Alissa Totman and Jackie Konopka to establish
										Stanford Synapse as an official student organization at
										Stanford. Since then, he has had the privilege of leading
										a team of passionate Stanford students to expand the
										group’s reach and impact on the brain injury community.
										After witnessing firsthand the importance of social
										support in the recovery process, Michael has organized
										initiatives and events to bring individuals with brain
										injury and Stanford students together in a safe and
										supportive environment. More recently, Michael has
										been involved in the founding of <a href='//synapsenational.org/'>Synapse National</a>,
										which is extending the model of the student-run support
										group to create a network of brain injury support
										groups at colleges across the country. After graduation,
										Michael plans to research and treat disorders of the
										brain as a physician-scientist.

									<h3>Sani Eskinazi ('20)</h3>
									<h4>Co-president</h4>
									<p>
										Sani is a Sophomore at Stanford majoring in Molecular,
										Cellular, and Developmental Biology with a minor in Economics.
										He enjoys working at the intersection of patient care,
										neuroscience research, and public service. After joining
										the club as a freshman and serving in outreach for a year,
										Sani currently leads the club with Michael’s mentorship.
										His experiences interacting with post brain injury
										individuals via his role in outreach allowed him to assume
										this executive position, and gave him the privilege of
										leading a team of passionate Stanford students. Having
										had a brain injury as a teenager, Sani sees Synapse as
										the optimal platform to learn more about the consequences
										of traumatic brain injury while giving back to society.
										Synapse has allowed Sani to further appreciate medicine’s
										unique role in combining the seemingly distinct fields of
										research and human interaction. After graduation, Sani
										plans on becoming a physician and taking care of patients
										on a daily basis, while also contributing to the management
										side of healthcare.

										Sophie studies Biology, with a concentration in Neurobiology,
										and Art Practice at Stanford. In her second year, Sophie
										assisted with the launch and development of Stanford Synapse
										as a new organization at Stanford. Sophie’s current role in
										Synapse involves organizing gatherings to help bring
										individuals with brain injury together for both social events
										and guest speakers that can be enjoyed with families and
										student buddies. In addition to her interests in neuroscience,
										Sophie is involved in research at the Stanford Cardiovascular
										Institute and plans to pursue an MD/PhD after graduation.

									<h3>Claire Woodrow ('18)</h3>
									<h4>Vice President of Buddy Program</h4>
									<p>
										Claire Woodrow is a senior undergraduate student pursuing a
										degree in Human Biology with a concentration in
										Neuroscience. After being introduced to patients suffering
										from brain trauma during high school, her desire for
										continued involvement with the brain injury community led
										her to join Stanford Synapse in its early stages during
										her freshman year. As initiator and organizer of the Buddy
										Program, Claire is inspired by the meaningful friendships
										Synapse helps to facilitate between individuals with brain
										injury and undergraduate students. Her personal experiences
										with her brain injury buddy constantly show her what a
										great impact Synapse has on those it serves. Claire is
										also a founding member of <a href='//synapsenational.org/'>Synapse National</a>, an organization
										which seeks to expand student support for the brain injury
										community to other universities across the country. In the
										future, Claire plans to continue studying the brain and
										hopefully become a physician.

									<h3>Rena Jiang ('20)</h3>
									<h4>Financial Officer</h4>
									<p>
										Rena Jiang is a sophomore undergraduate student majoring in
										biology with a concentration in neurobiology, and minoring
										in chemistry. She joined Stanford Synapse during freshman
										year as a way of supporting the local brain injury community
										and promoting awareness for brain injury. Rena is currently
										the Financial Officer of Stanford Synapse, but she also
										works with Sophia as part of the Events Committee as well.

									<h3>Alessandra Marcone ('20)</h3>
									<h4>Vice President of Outreach</h4>
									<p>
										Alessandra is a sophomore majoring in Human Biology with a
										minor in Spanish. Her junior year of high school Alessandra
										suffered from two concussions that forced her to quit soccer
										and sent her into a brief period of depression. Upon
										arriving on Stanford Campus, Alessandra joined Stanford
										Synapse as a freshman originally as a member of the core
										Outreach team. She is excited to continue to spread word
										about Stanford Synapse so more individuals with brain
										injuries can know about our peer support group -- a resource
										she believes would have been beneficial to her mental
										health during her own recovery from a concussion. In her
										free time Alessandra loves to dance, sing, and ski on the
										mountains of Alpine Meadows in Tahoe.

									<h3>Tami Alade ('19)</h3>
									<h4>Historian and VP of Quality Improvement</h4>
									<p>
										Tami is a junior majoring in Human Biology with a focus in
										child health and development. As a member of the varsity
										volleyball team at Stanford, she has been made witness to
										the devastating effect that head trauma can have both on
										the mental and physical health of the athletes around her.
										Tami is inspired by the power of support groups to create
										safe communities that allow for the growth and healing of
										the individuals who participate. In her year with Synapse,
										Tami has worked to document and share the photos and
										memories from the events that took place, and create a
										medium through which memories can be curated forever.
										After college, she hopes to pursue another degree in
										public health, and hopefully attend medical school.

									<h3>Isabel Goronzy ('18)</h3>
									<h4>VP of Peer Support</h4>
									<p>
										Isabel is a senior undergraduate at Stanford majoring in
										chemistry and minoring in computer science. After studying
										neuronal differentiation at the Stanford Stem Cell
										Institute, Isabel became fascinated with the plasticity and
										growth of the human nervous system and joined Stanford
										Synapse in an effort to witness how the human brain can
										recover from injury. As coordinator of the peer support
										group, she aims to build an all-inclusive environment where
										individuals with TBI can connect, gain strength from one
										another, share their struggles and achievements and gain
										hope that nature’s miraculous system will rebuild. She has
										been continuously awed by the resilience she witnesses at
										the biweekly peer support group meetings. After graduation,
										Isabel plans to study complex biological systems from a
										basic science perspective, applying high resolution
										methods to analyze biomolecules in their natural
										environment and uncovering mechanisms central to human
										health and medical care.
